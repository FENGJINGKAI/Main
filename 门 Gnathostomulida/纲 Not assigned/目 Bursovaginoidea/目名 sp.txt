名称 Bursovaginoidea
中文名 颚胃动物门
|
Bursovaginoids are rather small, ranging from a half of a millimeter to a full millimeter in length.
Many species in the order Bursovaginoidea have a narrow neck, making their head stand out more than other bursovagionoids and all filospermoids.
Bursovaginoids, unlike filospermoids, have paired sensory organs and a penis. Also, all species in Bursovaginoidea have a sperm-storage organ called a bursa. 
In suborder Scleroperalia, the bursa is cuticular, while in Conophoralia it is not. Species in order Conophoralia tend to have larger sperm than those in Sceloperalia.
