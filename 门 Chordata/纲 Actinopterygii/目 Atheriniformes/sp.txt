中文名：西班牙真银汉鱼
|
The body is rather long, slender and moderately flattened. The mouth is protrusible, directed upward with small teeth; the head and body are scaly.

The lower jaw has an upper expansion within the mouth (high dentary bone).

Two separate dorsal fins, all rays of first and 1-2 anterior rays of second dorsal fin are unsegmented, with the remaining rays segmented. The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin, while the caudal fin is forked. Body is silverish white, darker on the back, with the light blue horizontal stripe extending to the tail.[2]

The maximum size is up to 20 cm in length.[3]

Although rather small, as a carnivorous species, it feeds on pelagic copepods and benthic crustaceans.
