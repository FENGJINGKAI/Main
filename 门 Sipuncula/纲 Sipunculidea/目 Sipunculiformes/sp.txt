Sipunculus nudus (Linnaeus, 1766)
中文名：沙虫
|
As in all peanut worms, the body of S. nudus consists of a sac-like portion called the trunk and an eversible proboscis called the introvert. The mouth is located at the anterior end of the introvert and is surrounded by a group of tentacles. The body of the adult worm is around 15 centimetres (5.9 in) in length but can reach up to 25 cm (9.8 in) in some cases, of which about 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in) to 6 centimetres (2.4 in) correspond to the introvert.[1]

The epidermis contains a series of longitudinal coelomic canals that are connected to the main coelomic cavity by pores. Below the epidermis there are circular muscles surrounding the body which, as the coelomic canals, are marked on the surface, making the animal's surface be marked by rectangular ridges.
