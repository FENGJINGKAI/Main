Amphinomidae, also known as the bristle worms or sea mice,are a family of marine polychaetes, many species of which bear chaetae mineralized with carbonate.
The best-known amphinomids are the fireworms, which can cause great pain if their toxin-coated chaetae are touched or trodden on.
Their relationship to other polychaete groups is somewhat poorly resolved.
