Suberites domuncula is a species of sea sponge belonging to the family Suberitidae.
This species contains suberitine, a neurotoxin that can cause fatal hemolytic hemorrhaging in various animals. While it is highly toxic to fish, it is known to be preyed upon by the hawksbill turtle, Eretmochelys imbricata.
There are currently two accepted subspecies of this taxon: Suberites domuncula domuncula and S. domuncula latus. In 1893, Lambe described a new sponge species as Suberites latus. This was later determined to be a junior synonym of S. domuncula and merged into the species as a subspecies under the scientific name S. domuncula latus.
S domuncula is well known for colonizing gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs. At least 13 species of hermit crabs have been found associated with this sponge. It has also been recorded attached to the shells of live gastropods and the carapace of other crustaceans.
