Speleonectes atlantida (Koenemann et al., 2009)
中文名：无
|
Speleonectes atlantida is approximately 20 millimetres (0.8 in) long. Like most other remipedes, the species lacks eyes and is hermaphroditic. Adapted to life in caves, the long antennae sprouting from its head and the presence of sensory hairs along its body allow the crustacean to feel its way along the dark tunnel.[3]

The species is equipped with venom-injecting fangs,[2] a feature unique to class Remipedia among crustaceans.
