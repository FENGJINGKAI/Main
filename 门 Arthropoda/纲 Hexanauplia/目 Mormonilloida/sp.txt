Neomormonilla minor (Giesbrecht, 1891)
中文名：小摩门虱

Neomormonilla minor (Giesbrecht, 1891) is a small planktonic copepod distributed widely in intermediate and deep waters of the ocean, mainly at depths of 400-1000 m. The species was reported earlier only for the tropical Pacific Ocean (Central America, Galapagos Islands, and north of Peru). The present study provides the first record of females of the species for the southeastern Pacific, i.e., in the Humboldt Current System off the coast of northern Chile (23-27°S).
