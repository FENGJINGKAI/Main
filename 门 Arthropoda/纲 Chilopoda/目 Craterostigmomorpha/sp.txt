The Craterostigmomorpha are the least diverse centipede clade, comprising only two extant species, both in the genus Craterostigmus.
Their geographic range is restricted to Tasmania and New Zealand. They have a distinct body plan; 
their anamorphosis comprises a single stage: in their first moult, they grow from having 12 segments to having 15.
Their low diversity and intermediate position between the primitive anamorphic centipedes and the derived Epimorpha has led to them being likened to the platypus.
They represent the survivors of a once diverse clade.
Maternal brooding unites the Craterostigmomorpha with the Epimorpha into the clade Phylactometria. 
This trait is thought to be closely linked with the presence of sternal pores, which secrete sticky or noxious secretions, which mainly serve to repel predators and parasites.
The presence of these pores on the Devonian Devonobius permits its inclusion in this clade, allowing its divergence to be dated to 375 (or more) million years ago
