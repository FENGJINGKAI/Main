Stemmiulids are small to medium sized millipedes, reaching a maximum length of 50 mm (2 in). 
The body tapers gradually, and is laterally compressed, so is taller than wide. A dorsal groove is present and runs from head to tail. 
The eyes consist of two large ocelli on each side of the head, and some members are capable of jumping.
The living species lack Tömösváry organs, although a fossil species from the Miocene epoch possesses them.
