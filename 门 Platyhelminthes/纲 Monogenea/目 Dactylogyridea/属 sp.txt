Dactylogyrus (common name: Gill Fluke) are oviparous (egg-laying) monogeneans trematodes that have two pairs of anchors. 
These anchors can be used to latch onto the gills of a host, particularly freshwater fish such as carp. 
In heavily infected fish, Dactylogyrus can also be found on the buccal cavity, and at times fins and skin of the freshwater fish.
