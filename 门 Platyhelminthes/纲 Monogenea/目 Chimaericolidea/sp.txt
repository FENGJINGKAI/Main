Chimaericola leptogaster is a species of polyopisthocotylean monogenean in the family Chimaericolidae. It is ectoparasitic on the gills of the chimaera Chimaera monstrosa.

Chimaericola leptogaster is a large monogenean, reaching 50 mm in length. The haptor, at the posterior end of the body, bears eight clamps arranged as two rows of four.

The first molecular sequences obtained from Chimaericola leptogaster suggested that the Chimaericolidae were a basal group within the Polyopisthocotylea.

Chimaericola leptogaster was studied with transmission electron microscopy. Several organs have been investigated in details: vaginae, clamps, digestive system,[8] and spermiogenesis and spermatozoa. These ultrastructural results have confirmed the basal position of the species in comparison to marine Polyopisthocotylea.
