With all the features of the family. Apical sucker provided at its opening with strong sphinoter-like circular muscles. Neck may show genital primordia. Strobila round or oval in cross section; proglottides increasing in length posteriorly, first segment broader than long, second segment variable, third segment always longer than broad. Segments with parallel or convex sides, elliptical to oval when gravid; gravid segments retained on strobila but easily detached. Inner longitudinal muscles not bundled, but forming definite sheath, attached to sphincter-like anterior end of apical sucker. Longitudinal excretory vessels numerous in cortex but few in medulla. Nerve trunk ventral to cirrus pouch and vagina. Testes confined to previtellarian medulla, absent from gravid proglottides. Cirrus pouch thin-walled,situated for most part in medullary parenchyma, contains simple cirrus and convoluted ductus ejaculatorius, whose proximal part may serve as an internal seminal vesicle. Genital atrium opens on or near right or left margin within anterior third of proglottid. Ovary consists of two symmetrical lateral lobes and median isthmus, situated in middle third of proglottid. Vitellaria consists of two symmetrical lateral lobes, each of which lies immediately in front of corresponding part of ovary. Vagina opens into genital atrium immediately behind cirrus, may be more or less distended with spermatozoa before joining oviduct. Uterus extends in close transverse coils in central and dorsal medulla from posterior end of proglottid inro testicular zone in mature proglottides but occupying entire or almost entire medulla when fully developed. Eggs three-shelled; outer shell delicate, large; middle shell rather rigid, small; inner shell thin, membranous. Parastic in intestine of freshwater teleosts. (Amended from Yamaguti(1939).)
