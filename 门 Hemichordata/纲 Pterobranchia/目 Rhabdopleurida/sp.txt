This species grows in colonies. Each individual achieves a length of 0.5 mm, with a total colony length of approximately 20 mm.

Located on the tentacles are lateral, frontal, and frontolateral ciliary bands. These are 8-13 μm in length and composed of cilia. In specimens collected in Bermuda, ciliated perforations were found. These ran down the length of the arms, in particular, between the bases of other tentacles laying adjacent.
