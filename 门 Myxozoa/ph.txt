Myxozoa ( etymology : Greek : μύξα myxa "slime" or "mucus" [1] + thematic vowel o + ζῷον zoon "animal" [2] ) is an unranked subphylum of aquatic, obligately parasitic cnidarian animals and contains the smallest animals ever known to have lived. Over 2180 species have been described [3] and some estimates have suggested at least 30,000 undiscovered species. [4] Many have a two-host lifecycle, involving a fish and an annelid worm or a bryozoan . The average size of a myxosporean spore usually ranges from 10 μm to 20 μm, [5] whereas that of a malacosporean (a subclade of the Myxozoa) spore can be up to 2 mm. Myxozoans can live in both freshwater and marine habitats.

While the evolutionary history of myxozoans is still an active area of research, it is now understood that myxozoans are highly derived cnidarians that have undergone dramatic evolution from a free swimming, self-sufficient jellyfish-like creature into their current form of obligate parasites composed of a mere handful of cells. [6] As myxozoans evolved into microscopic parasites, they lost many genes responsible for multicellular development, coordination, cell-cell communication, and even, in some cases, aerobic respiration. [7] The genomes of some myxozoans are now among the smallest genomes of any known animal species. [8]
