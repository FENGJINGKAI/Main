This nasty looking creature is a rather poisonous jellyfish called Chirodropus gorilla.  
They have only been seen in Namibia in the last few years, mainly down in the south of the country around Luderitz. 
We photographed this one there and report sightings of it to the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources whenever we see them.
