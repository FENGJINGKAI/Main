Heliopora coerulea (Pallas, 1766)
中文名：蓝珊瑚
|
The blue coral is the only extant octocoral with a massive skeleton,[2] which is composed of fibrocrystalline aragonite (calcium carbonate). It is a hermatypic zooxanthellaete species with either blue or grey-grey polyps located within its skeleton, which each contain eight tentacles. Its colonies are either columnar, plates or branched.[4][5] It is a tolerant species and is used in marine aquariums.

Iron salts give the skeleton of Heliopora coerulea its unique color, which allows for easy recognition in fossil outcrops.[6] As such, it is fairly abundant within paleontology, with fossils indicating the species has remained unchanged since the Cretaceous.[6]
