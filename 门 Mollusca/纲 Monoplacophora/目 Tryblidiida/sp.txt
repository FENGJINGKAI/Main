The body of Neopilina is more or less bilaterally symmetrical and exhibits metameric segmentations like annelids. Neopilina galatheae is about 3.7 cm long, 3.3 cm wide and 1.4 cm high. The dorsal side of the body is covered by a thin shell. The shell is circu­lar in outline. The apex of the shell is drawn anteriorly and is slightly bent

The shell is composed of a thick calcareous middle prismatic and innermost calcareous nacreous layer, covered over by periostracum. These three layers of the shell are formed from the margin of the mantle.

The soft parts of the body are seen only from the ventral side. There is a large flat foot like that of Chiton. Surrounding the foot and head there is a deep pallial groove contain­ing five pairs of gills.

The mouth is situated medially in front of the foot and the anus is located posterior to the foot. In front of the mouth there is a transverse labial swelling which prolongs laterally into two ciliated lobes, one on each side.

These ciliated lobes are comparable to the anterior labial palps of Unio. Anterior to the transverse swelling there is a pair of small pre-oral ten­tacles. There is a swollen labium which bears a number of postoral tentacles on the anterior surface.

There are eight pairs of dorso-ventral muscles in Neopilina (Fig. 16.3A). These muscles originate from the shell and extend to the median wall of the pallial groove. The dorso-ventral muscles correspond to the columellar muscles of the gastropods.
