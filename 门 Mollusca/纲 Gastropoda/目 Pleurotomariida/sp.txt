|
The width of this large gastropod shell is 130–285 mm.[3] The shell has a broadly conoid shape with a convex base. It is moderately umbilicated, the umbilicus penetrating to the apex. It is a little plicated within by the prominent growth lines. The color is yellowish-white, with flames of orange or carmine red, and light violet, particularly developed on the body whorl. The apex is eroded and yellow. The number of whorls is uncertain, probably between 11 and 13. The whorls are visibly convex and divided into nearly equal portions by the slit fasciole, which is a little above the middle. The sculpture is composed of oblique, radiating striae, more prominent on the upper whorls. The base of the shell is almost smooth, with a slight stride of growth and very fine concentric lines. The nacreous aperture is obliquely quadrangular. The basal margin is continuous with the columella, and is not angulated at its junction with it.
