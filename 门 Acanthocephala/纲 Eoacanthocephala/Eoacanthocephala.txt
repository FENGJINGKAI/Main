Eoacanthocephala is a class of parasitic worms, within the phylum Acanthocephala. They feed on any aquatic cold-blooded creature such as turtles and fish.[2] Their proboscis spines arranged radially, no protonephridia, persistent ligament sacs in female. The only reliable way to identify the group is that they only have one cement gland. This is a primitive characteristic and hence the name. The class contains 2 orders:

Gyracanthocephala Van Cleave, 1936
Neoechinorhynchida Southwell and Macfie, 1925
