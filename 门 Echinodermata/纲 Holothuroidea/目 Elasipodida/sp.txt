Elpidia minutissima （Belyaev, 1971）

Description：Specimens collected from the Aleutian Trench averaged 13 mm (0.5 in) in length and had three pairs of dorsal podia whereas specimens collected from Station M in the northeastern Pacific Ocean at a depth of about 4,000 metres (13,000 ft) had four pairs, two pairs on the dorsal surface and two pairs on the ventral surface, the hindermost of the ventral podia being shorter than the others. At times of low abundance, the average length of these sea cucumbers was similar to the specimens from the Aleutian Trench but at times of high abundance it increased to 25 mm (1.0 in). It is possible that these two populations are not in fact the same species.
